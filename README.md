# geometrical_verificator
This C program determines whether a given point lies **inside or outside** a **circle** and a **rectangle** on a Cartesian plane. Based on user-provided coordinates, it calculates the point‚Äôs relative position with respect to both shapes.
# Point Verification in Circle and Rectangle (C Language)

## üßÆ What Does It Do?

1. Prompts the user to enter:
   - The center and radius of the circle.
   - Coordinates of two opposite vertices of the rectangle.
   - Coordinates of the point to analyze.
2. Verifies:
   - If the point is inside the circle.
   - If the point is inside the rectangle.
   - If the point is inside both or neither.
3. Displays the result in the terminal.
